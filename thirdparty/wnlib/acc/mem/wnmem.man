DESCRIPTION
     This package is a memory allocator designed to replace
     the malloc(3) package provided by UNIX.  It is designed
     to be faster and easier to program.

     All memory comes from a "memory group", which can be declared
     using the type "wn_memgp".  wnmem keeps a stack of memory
     groups.  The top of this stack is called the "current memory
     group" and can be accessed using "wn_curgp".  All memory is
     allocated from and freed to the current memory group.  The
     current memory group is NULL until a "wn_gppush" or "wn_gpmake"
     is done.
      
     "wn_gppush" pushes "group" onto the memory group stack.

     "wn_gppop" pops the memory group stack.

     "wn_gpmake" makes a memory group of type specified by "parms"
     and pushes it onto the memory group stack.  "parms" is a string 
     with the following syntax:

       parms --> free_method chunk_size

       free_method --> "no_free"|"general_free" 

       chunk_size --> <non-negative integer>|<empty>

     "free method" controls how "wn_free" works.
     "no_free" means that "wn_free" does nothing.  "no_free" groups
     run much faster and waste less space.  "general_free" groups
     allow piecemeal freeing with "wn_free".  Note that "wn_gpfree" works for
     both types of groups.  "chunk_size" is the size of the memory
     chunk that wnmem requests from the system.  The default is
     4000, which is a good choice unless you have many small groups.
     Giving 0 causes the smallest chunk possible to be requested.

     Some example wn_gpmake calls follow:

       wn_gpmake("no_free");
       wn_gpmake("general_free");
       wn_gpmake("no_free 100");
       wn_gpmake("no_free 0");

     The memory group created by "wn_gpmake" is a subgroup of
     the current group.  If a group is freed, all of its
     subgroups are freed.  If the current group is NULL,
     the memory group is a subgroup of no other group.

     "wn_gpfree" frees all of the memory in the current memory group,
     recursively frees its subgroups, invalidates the group,
     and then pops it from memory group stack.

     "wn_alloc" allocates "size" bytes from the current memory
     group and returns a pointer to it.

     "wn_zalloc" allocates "size" bytes from the current memory
     group and returns a pointer to it.  The memory is guaranteed
     to be null initialized.

     "wn_free" frees memory pointed to by "p" into the current memory
     group.  This group must be the same group that "p" was allocated
     from or trouble will result.  "wn_free" only works for "general_free"
     memory groups; it will do nothing for a "no_free" group.

     "wn_realloc" changes the size of a block of memory referenced by "p".
     "p" may be moved.

     "wn_zrealloc" does the same as "wn_realloc" except that all extra
     memory allocated will be null initialized.

     "wn_curgp" returns the current memory group.

     "wn_defaultgp" returns the "default" memory group, which
     is a no_free group used for various system purposes.

     "wn_set_system_memory_alloc_func" and
     "wn_set_system_memory_free_func" set new functions that wnmem is to
     call for its internal allocation and freeing.  The function pointers
     to be passed to these functions are to have the same argument and return
     types as malloc() and free().  If not called, wnmem uses malloc() and
     free().  Once these are called, all allocation for all groups goes
     through the new routines -- it recommended to call them before
     wnmem is initialized.

     "WN_GPBEGIN" and "WN_GPBEGINF" are macros analogous to wn_gpmake()
     and wn_gpmakef(), except that they begin a "{" block of code where
     the group is on the stack.  The block must be terminated with a
     "WN_GPEND()".  These macros store a pointer to the group made in
     a local variable, and "WN_GPEND()" checks that it matches with the
     group on the stacktop before freeing it.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If memory is exhausted, the function provided to "wn_gperrfpush"
     is called.  By default, this function prints a message and
     then crashes.

     "wn_alloc", "wn_zalloc", and "wn_free" crash if the current
     memory group is NULL.
