DESCRIPTION
     This package defines a singly linked list type called
     "wn_sll".  Routines and macros operate on lists and elements
     of lists.  

     The declaration

       wn_sll ll;

     declares a list element, which is also a list.  The fragment

       ll->next

     refers to the next linked list element.  The fragment

       ll->contents

     is a pointer associated with the linked list element.

     "wn_mksll" allocates a "wn_sll" from the current memory group.
     "ll->next" and "ll->contents" are NULL.

     "wn_sllins" inserts e into list "list" by allocating a list
     element (from the current memory group), setting its "contents"
     to "e", and chaining it to the front of "list".

     "wn_slleins" chains "el" to the front of "list".

     "wn_slldel" searches "list" until it finds a list element
     with "contents" == "e".  This element is deleted from
     the list and freed into the current memory group.

     "wn_slledel" deletes the list element *pel from its
     containing list by setting "*pel = (*pel)->next;".  Then
     the list element is freed into the current memory group.

     "wn_slleunlink" deletes the list element *pel from its
     containing list by setting "*pel = (*pel)->next;". 

     "wn_sllindex" places the contents of the "index"'th element of
     "list" into "contents".  Unreasonable values of "index" are NOT 
     trapped.

     "wn_slleindex" places the "index"'th element of
     "list" into "el".  Unreasonable values of "index" are NOT 
     trapped.

     "wn_sllrev" reverses the order of "list".  Useful because
     "wn_sllins" leaves the list reversed from the order of insertion.

     "wn_sllcpy" places a memory-allocated copy of "in" into "out".
     The memory is allocated from the current memory group.

     "wn_sllcat" concatonates "in" to the end of "out", preserving
     the order of both.  No new memory is allocated.

     "wn_sllins_sll" chains the list "in" to the front of "out".

     "wn_sllend" places the last "->next" pointer of "list" into
     "pend".

     "wn_slllast" gets the last element of "list".

     "wn_sllempty" returns TRUE iff "list" is empty.

     "wn_sllcount" returns the number of entries in "list".

     "wn_randomize_sll" randomizes the order of "list" using the
     random number generator "wnrnd".

     ----------------------------------------------------------------

     This package also defines macros WN_FOR_LIST() and WN_END_FOR_LIST()
     for easy creation of loops to traverse linked lists.

     If you have

       typedef struct ab_blah_struct *ab_blah;
       struct ab_blah_struct {
         int x, y;
       };

     and you build a list mylist where mylist is of type wn_sll and
     the contents of each node is a pointer to an ab_blah struct, you
     can traverse the list by saying    

       WN_FOR_LIST( ab_blah, my_blah, mylist) {
         ...
         guts of loop, for example:
         ...
         printf("(%d, %d)\n", my_blah->x, my_blah->y);
       } WN_END_FOR_LIST();

     Note that the variable my_blah is not declared by the caller,
     it is declared by the macro WN_FOR_LIST() to be of type ab_blah
     and assigned to by the macro.

     "break"s and "continue"s within the loop work as they should.
