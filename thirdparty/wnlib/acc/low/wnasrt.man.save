DESCRIPTION
     "wn_assert" evaluates "condition".  If "condition" is TRUE, execution
     continues.  If "condition" is FALSE, it prints a message giving the
     file name and line number where it was called from.  Then it crashes
     the application using abort(3).

     "wn_assert_notreached" prints a message giving the file name and 
     line number where it was called from.  Then it crashes the
     application using abort(3).

     "wn_assert_warn" evaluates "condition".  If "condition" is FALSE, it 
     prints a message giving the file name and line number where it was
     called from.

     "wn_assert_warn_notreached" prints a message giving the file name and 
     line number where it was called from.

     The above 4 routines may also print messages indicating function name
     and in the case of asserts, the expression that failed.  This
     functionality may not be available on all platforms.

     "wn_set_assert_print" allows the programmer to change the
     routine used for printing messages.  The default is to print
     to standard error, as specified in "wn_default_assert_print".

     "wn_set_assert_crash" allows the programmer to change the
     routine used for crashing, or perhaps to a routine that does not
     crash (does a longjump, for example).  The default is to crash
     the application using abort(3), as specified in "wn_default_assert_crash".

     wn_assert*() are expressions, not statements.  They are of type void.
     They can be used like statements, or used within expressions, but they
     don't return a value.  Their being able to be used in expressions comes
     in useful in complex macros.  Otherwise they can be treated
     syntactically like subroutine calls of type void.
    
     wn_fast_*() are like the corresponding identifiers without the "_fast",
     except that if "WN_FAST" is defined they just become void constant
     expressions.  This way you can have asserts that are slow to evaluate
     happen when you are tweaking your code, then have them basically
     disappear when you want to speed things up for production.  Note that
     the original wn_assert...( identifiers are ALWAYS to happen, they are
     never to be compiled out of existence.

     wn_assert*() calls can be overridden with environment variables.  If
     the appropriate override is set, a given assert will not bomb, and it
     will not print the usual error message.  The first time any suppressed
     assert or notreached is triggered, a small warning is produced, later
     calls are all silent.

     To override an assert or notreached, get the filename and line number,
     and run the xlateasrt program in wnlib/acc/low with

	xlateasrt -override_code <filename> <line number>

     Set and export the given environment variable, and rerun the program,
     the assert / notreached will be suppressed.

EXAMPLE

     The user may say

	wn_assert(i == 2);

     somewhere in his code.  If i != 2 when this statement gets evaluated,
     the assert fails.  A message something like this is printed

	------------------------------------------------------------
			       HELP!!!
	This program has encountered a severe internal error.
	Please report the following message to the
	program's developers so that they can fix the problem,
	an override may be available:
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Assertion botched -- forcing crash
	Expr (i == 2) was false
	in foo_routine() at line 57 in file barfile.c
        Aborted

     and the program aborts.

     If, upon examining the code, a decision is made that the assert should
     be ignored, it can be overridden.  To get the environment variable
     that must be set, run xlateasrt in wnlib/acc/low with -override_code,
     giving it the filename and line number from the message

	% xlateasrt -override_code barfile.c 57

     and it will give you a long name of an environment variable, in this case

	Override string == "WN_ASSERT_SUPPRESS_barfile_c_57_91120e3f"

     Set and export this variable.  On bash and sh, say

	% WN_ASSERT_SUPPRESS_barfile_c_57_91120e3f=
	% export WN_ASSERT_SUPPRESS_barfile_c_57_91120e3f

     On csh and tcsh, say

	% setenv WN_ASSERT_SUPPRESS_barfile_c_57_91120e3f

     Then run your program again, when it encounters the problem, you will
     get a brief message

	Warning: at least one assert suppressed, by environment variable
	    "WN_ASSERT_SUPPRESS_barfile_c_57_91120e3f"

     but nothing else, your program will continue on, and subsequent
     encounters to the same problem will be silent.

     This suppression only suppresses the error encountered on barfile.c,
     line 57.  All other asserts and notreached's are unaffected and still
     capable of generating full warnings and/or bombing out.  Multiple
     asserts can be suppressed at once, but you will only get the warning
     on the first one encountered.
