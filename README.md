MAGICAL: Machine Generated Analog IC Layout

This is the top-level MAGICAL flow repository. In MAGICAL, we maintain seperate components, such as constraint generation, placement and routing, in different repository. And we integrate each component through top-level python flow.
This project is currently still under active development.

# How to clone #

To clone the repository and submodules, go to the path to download the repository. 
```
# clone the repository 
git clone https://github.com/magical-eda/MAGICAL.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

# How to build #

To build, run make in the root directory. 
```
./build.sh
```
GCC 4.8 or later is preferred. 
Export CC and CXX environment variables for custom gcc and g++ path, respectively. 

# How to run #

Benchmark circuit examples are under examples/

All technology related parameters including benchmark circuit sizing are samples and not related to any proprietary PDK information.

Benchmark circuits currently includes:
1 adc2
3 ota3

To run the benchmark circuits
```
cd BENCH/ (ex. adc2)
source run.sh
```

The output layout gdsii files: BENCH/BENCH.route.gds (ex. adc2/xxx.route.gds)

# Custom layout constraint inputs #

The automatic symmetry constraint generation is currently embedded into the flow. To ensure circuit functionality it is ideal that designers provide  constraints to guide the placement and routing. 

A sample device and net symmetry constraint is given for adc2. These files should also be the output for the current automatic symmetry constraint generation flow.

Sample symmetry device constraint file:
examples/adc2/CTDSM_CORE_NEW_schematic.sym

Sample symmetry net constraint file:
examples/adc2/CTDSM_CORE_NEW_schematic.symnet

## Device symmetry constraints

Device symmetry constraints greatly affect the placement solution and output layout quality. Currently we only consider symmetry groups, symmetry device pairs and self-symmetric device constraints.

**Symmetry group**: A group of symmetry device pairs and self-symmetric devices that share the same symmetry axis.

**Symmetry device pair**: Two devices that are reflection symmetric with respect to a symmetry axis (usually vertical).

**Self-symmetry device**: A single device that is reflection symmetric with itself respect to a symmetry axis.

## Net symmetry constraints

Similar to device symmetry constraints, we consider symmetry net pairs and self-symmetry net constraints. 

**Symmetry net pair**: Two nets that are reflection symmetric with respect to a symmetry axis (usually vertical). For a valid constraint, the corresponding pins of the two nets must be reflective symmetric with a axix.

**Self-symmetry net**: A single net that is reflection symmetric with itself respect to a symmetry axis.
